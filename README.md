# How positive was your week?

A code sample that aims to answer the question of how positive your week using the [Recent Search endpoint of Twitter Developer Labs](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/labs/recent-search/overview) and [Microsoft Azure's Text Analytics Cognitive Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/text-analytics/) to detect languages and determine sentiment scores.

For this code to run you will need to set up a configuration file with your secrets, a sample of this can be found under `config.yaml`. Be sure to add your `config.yaml` to your `.gitignore` and check out [our guide on securing keys and tokens](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/securing-keys-and-tokens).
